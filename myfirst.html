                <h3>Past</h3>
                <p>This is literally the second website I have ever made from scratch. I made one in CNIT 131, which was slightly less basic than this one. The only difference between this website and my previous is that I am using my own content as opposed to using content from the guide I was presented in CNIT 131. Also, I am using GitHub for this particular website which is new to me

                <h3>Other</h3>
                <p>I have made other websites using canned website makers companies (see below). I couldn't possibly imagine what it would take to build a canned website from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>The last 3 websites I have made are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>connectionretail.com (no longer available)</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.databasemerge.com" target="blank">Database Merge</a></li>
                    <li>classpatch.com (no longer available)</li>
</ul>
