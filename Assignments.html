            Hello. My name is Philip Burkart. I am 37 years old. There have been essentially 3 major events that define my life. 1) I lived in China for 6 years. 2) I have gone to school enough to complete a BA and two MSc degrees. 3) I have been in the military for 5 years.

            I do not have a particular path in web development, but it is a topic that interests me. I am very interested in the idea of creating a website with a backend where clients can log in and interact with the site in a meaningul way. My favorite website that does this is <a href="https://www.customerlobby.com/">Customer Lobby</a>. I like this site because it allows small business owners to create campaigns using a simple mapping system that downloads via the backend of the Customer Lobby website. I doubt I will ever be able to make such a website, but maybe understanding the process will help me if ever I hire someone to help me.

                <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3</a>: Generally speaking, this is a great first stop to understanding basic HTML5.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a>: Once you have your website coding complete, you can check which domains are available on GoDaddy.</li>    
            <li><a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank">Wix</a>: Ultimately, it might make more sense to combine a canned website with your basic HTML5 abilities, which you do at Wix.</li>
